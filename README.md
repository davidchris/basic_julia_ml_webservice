# basic_julia_ml_webservice
In this repo I tried to build a web service in Julia that can give prediction from a machine learning algorithm. This code uses and adapts from the tutorial here: http://marubon-ds.blogspot.com/2018/05/how-to-make-http-server-for-prediction.html


# Package for web service 
I am using the package HTTP.jl [https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl].

# Evaluating prediction speed
I use the package BenchmarkTools.jl [https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl].
